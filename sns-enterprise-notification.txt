Email and Slack Notification System via AWS SNS & Lambda

This project is a serverless notification pipeline that ingests files via Amazon S3, stores metadata in DynamoDB, and sends structured alerts to Email and Slack (Enterprise Grid) using AWS Lambda and SNS.


 Components

- AWS Lambda: Automatically triggered on new S3 object upload. Parses file, stores metadata, and publishes to an SNS topic.
- Amazon DynamoDB: Stores structured metadata about each file (filename, timestamp, uploader, etc.).
- Amazon SNS: Publishes structured messages.
- SNS Subscription: send notification to Email
- Slack: Receives notifications via an HTTPS endpoint (webhook URL) subscribed to the SNS topic.
